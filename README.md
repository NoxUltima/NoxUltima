- 👋 Hi, I’m @NoxUltima. Nothing special about me, just a regular college guy
- 👀 I’m interested in functional programming, typography, programming languages, linguistics, music and most of all, I write!
  - My favorite language is Scala
- 🌱 I’m currently learning TypeScript, React, Angular
- 💞️ I’m working on:
  - **Nyx**, soon to be my first programming language
  - A new book
- 📫 I remain private until I'm a bit older.
