- 👋 Hi, I’m @NoxUltima. Nothing special about me, just a regular college guy
- 👀 I’m interested in functional programming, typography, programming languages, linguistics, music and most of all, I write!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning TypeScript, React and even more Python
- 💞️ I’m working on documentation for my own programming language called Nyx (name not finalized yet)
- 📫 I remain private until I'm a bit older.
