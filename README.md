- 👋 Hi, I’m @NoxUltima. Nothing special about me, I'm still in college
- 👀 I’m interested in functional programming, typography, programming languages, linguistics, music and most of all, I write!
  - My favorite languages so far are Scala, Haskell and ReasonML
- 🌱 I’m currently learning TypeScript, React, Angular
- 💞️ I’m working on:
  - **Nyx**, soon to be my first programming language
  - A new book
- 📫 I am not active on this platform until I have the time to do so.
